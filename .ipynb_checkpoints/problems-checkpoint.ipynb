    "Now we are heading towards some super simple but interesting algebraic number theory. First, I want you to generate a `list` (see [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)) of prime numbers less than $100$. Note that prime numbers are natural numbers (not one and zero) that are not divisible by any number other than $1$ and themselves. Take $7$ for instance. $7/1 = 7, 7/2 = 3.5, 7/3=2.3333..., 7/4=1.75, 7/5=1.4, 7/6=1.166666..., 7/7=1$. Therefore, $7$ is a prime. You can check the numbers less than $100$ in this way with the operation `%` for divisibility. Note that if you want to check $x$, and there is some natural number $a \\geqslant \\sqrt{x}$ that divides $x$ then there must exist some number $b \\leqslant \\sqrt{x}$ that divides $x$ since\n",
